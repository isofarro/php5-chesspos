ChessPos
--------

A small app to dynamically create images for chess positions using [Forsythe-Edwards Notation (FEN)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) as the filename.

It supports FEN notation, but uses `-` instead of `/` as the separation character.

Requires:

* PHP 5.3+
* GD
